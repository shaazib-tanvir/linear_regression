## Why Does This Exist?

For me to learn how to do linear regression. I don't expect anyone to actually use a linear model to predict GDP since it has way too little parameters to be of any practical utility.

## Packages Used

- PyTorch (<https://pytorch.org>)
- Matplotlib (<https://matplotlib.org/>)
- Pandas (<https://pandas.pydata.org/>)
